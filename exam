As per wiki, Bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher. Bcrypt uses adaptive hash algorithm to store password, which is a one-way hash of the password. BCrypt internally generates a random salt while encoding passwords and store that salt along with the encrypted password. Hence, it is obvious to get different encoded results for the same string. But one common thing is that everytime it generates a String of length 60.
